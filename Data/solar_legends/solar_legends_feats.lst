# Fixed the Brawl/Martial Arts problem by adding a template 'Unarmed Lethal Strike' that includes a Natural Attack of the same name,
# to get a second object for outputting the differing results. The Brawl and Martial Arts feats now modify the two 'unarmed' objects
# accordingly																		- Frank Kliewe
