Blind-Fight		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:In melee, every time a character misses because of concealment, the character can reroll the miss chance percentile roll one time to see if the character actually hit.  An invisible attacker gets no bonus to hit the character in melee.  That is, the character doesn't lose a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.  The character suffers only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces the character's speed to three-quarters of normal, instead of one-half.													
Cleave		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Armor Proficiency (light)					PRESTAT:1,STR=13		DESC:If the character deals a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points, killing it, etc.), the character gets an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature in the immediate vicinity. The character cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. The character can use this ability once per round.													
Combat Reflexes		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:When foes leave themselves open, the character may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to the character's Dexterity modifier. The character still may only make one attack of opportunity per enemy.													
Dodge		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PRESTAT:1,DEX=13								DESC:During the character's action, the character designates an opponent and receives a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks from that opponent. The character can select a new opponent on any action. Note: A condition that makes the character lose his or her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes the character lose dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.													
Endurance		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:Whenever the character makes a check for performing a physical action that extends over a period of time (running, swimming, holding the character's breath, and so on), the character gets a +4 bonus to the check.													
Exotic Weapon Proficiency		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREVARGTEQ:BAB,1								DESC:The character makes attack rolls with the weapon normally.

This number may not exceed the character's base attack bonus. The changes to attack rolls and Armor Class last until the character's next action. The bonus to the character's Armor Class is a dodge bonus.													
Far Shot		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot								DESC:When the character uses a projectile weapon, such as a bow, its range increment increases by one-half (multiply by 1.5).

Improved Critical		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREVARGTEQ:BAB,8								DESC:When using the weapon the character selected, the character's threat range is doubled.													
Improved Disarm		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Expertise					PRESTAT:1,INT=13			DESC:The character does not suffer an attack of opportunity when the character attempts to disarm an opponent, nor does the opponent have a chance to disarm.													
Improved Improvised Weapon		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:The character does not suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls with improvised weapons that they are familiar with.  An engineer, as as example, would be familiar with engineering tools.  A character with a sports background would be familiar with some sports equipment.													
Improved Initiative		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:The character gets a +4 bonus on initiative checks.													
Improved Trip		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Expertise					PRESTAT:1,INT=13			DESC:If the character trips an opponent in melee combat, the character immediately gets a melee attack against that opponent as if the character hadn't used the character's attack for the trip attempt.

Improved Unarmed Strike		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:The character is considered to be armed even when unarmed-that is, armed opponents do not get attacks of opportunity when the character attacks them while unarmed. However, the character still gets an opportunity attack against any opponent who makes an unarmed attack on the character.													
Leadership		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her. See Table: Leadership for what sort of cohort and how many followers the character can recruit.													
Martial Weapon Proficiency		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:The character makes attack rolls with the weapon normally.													
Mobility		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge					PRESTAT:1,DEX=13			DESC:The character gets a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when the character moves out of or within a threatened area. Note: A condition that makes the character lose the Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes the character lose dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.													
Mounted Combat		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:Once per round when the character's mount/vehicle is hit in combat, the character may make a Drive check to negate the hit. The hit is negated if the character's Drive check is greater than the attack roll (essentially, the Drive check becomes the mount's Armor Class if it's higher than the mount's regular AC).

This number may not exceed the character's base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage applies until the character's next action.													
Precise Shot		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot								DESC:The character can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without suffering the standard -4 penalty.
Quick Draw		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREVARGTEQ:BAB,1								DESC:The character can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a movement-equivalent action.													
Rapid Shot		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot			DESC:The character can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at the character's highest base attack bonus, but each attack (the extra one and the normal ones) suffers a -2 penalty. The character must use the full attack action to use this feat.															PRESTAT:1,DEX=13			DESC:
Run		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:When running, the character moves five times normal speed instead of four times normal speed. If the character makes a running jump, increase the distance or height cleared by one-fourth, but not past the maximum.													
Shot on the Run		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot,Dodge,Mobility					PRESTAT:1,DEX=15			DESC:When using the attack action with a ranged weapon, the character can move both before and after the attack, provided that the character's total distance moved is not greater than the character's speed.

Spring Attack		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot,Dodge,Mobility					PREVARGTEQ:BAB,4			DESC:When using the attack action with a melee weapon, the character can move both before and after the attack, provided that the character’s total distance moved is not greater than the character’s speed. Moving in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender the character attacks. The character can’t use this feat if the character is in heavy armor.													
Stunning Fist		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike					PREVARGTEQ:BAB,1			DESC:Declare that the character is using the feat before making an attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). It forces a foe damaged by the character’s unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + one-half the character’s level + Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. If the defender fails his saving throw, he is stunned for 1 round (until just before the character’s next action). A stunned character can’t act and loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Attackers get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a stunned opponent. The character may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels attained, and no more than once per round.													
Toughness		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:The character gains +3 hit points.													
Track		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:To find tracks or to follow them for one mile requires a Wisdom check.

Trample		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mounted Combat								DESC:When the character attempts to overrun an opponent while mounted, the target may not choose to avoid the character.

Two-Weapon Fighting		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:The character's penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by 2.													
Weapon Finesse		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREVARGTEQ:BAB,1								DESC:With the selected weapon, the character may use a Dexterity modifier instead of a Strength modifier on attack rolls. Since the character needs the second hand for balance, apply the armor check penalty of any shield worn to attack rolls.													
Weapon Focus		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREVARGTEQ:BAB,1								DESC:The character adds +1 to all attack rolls the character makes using the selected weapon.  Special: The character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time the character takes the feat, it applies to a new weapon.													
Weapon Specialization		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General													DESC:The character adds +2 to all damage inflicted with the weapon the character has specialized with. If the weapon is a ranged weapon, the target must be within 30 feet.
